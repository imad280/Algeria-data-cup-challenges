# Algeria-data-cup-challenges
This repository showcases our efforts and contributions to an exciting set of challenges proposed in a datathon where the goal was to develop robust models to model the provided datasets.

<ul>
  <li><b>Loan propensity prediction</b>: The objective of this challenge was to predict a bank's client propensity for loans (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/sga-loan-propensity-prediction-challenge">link to the competition</a>). To attempt that, we modeled the dataset in 4 models: Decision tree, Random Forest, XGBoost and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The different accuracies are in the notebook.</li>
  <li><b>Overdue deadlines prediction</b>: The objective of this challenge was to predict the number of overdue deadlines for a bank (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/sga-overdue-deadlines-prediction-challenge">link to the competition</a>). As a solution, we attempted 3 models: Linear Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost. The results of the modelisation will be found in the notebook.</li>
<li><b>Purchase prediction</b>: The goal of this challenge is to predict whether a client will make a purchase on a specific date (<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/immar-purchase-prediction-challenge1/overview">link to the competition</a>. The model that we constructed was by using XGBoost. The results can be found in the notebook.</li>
<li><b>Clustering challenge</b>: This challenge was an additional task in the competiton. It consisted in a client segmentation task. The methods we used were: DBSCAN and K-means. The results are on the correspending notebook.</li>
</ul>
